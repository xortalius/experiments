Projects
========

This is a repository of various small projects that I've found interesting. 

__Projects__:
* fluids/ - Experiments with a fluid simulation method known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. Includes a complete description of the simulation method, starting from fundamental fluid mechanics to derive the Navier-Stokes equations, followed by a derivation of the simulation steps from the Navier-Stokes equations. Also includes a very quick and dirty Java implementation of the simulation method. 
* morph/ - Experiments with simple image interpolation / morphing. 
* neural-network/ 
* cpu/ - A toy CPU created in Verilog for use with a Cyclone II Altera Starter Kit FPGA board. The CPU executes (compiled versions of) a custom MIPS-like assembly language; the compiler for this language and the description are in simple/.
* simple/ - A toy C-like language called "Simple", which compiles to a custom MIPS-like assembly, which can execute on a custom CPU for a Cyclone II FPGA board.
* quadcopter/ - A detailed description of quadcopter motion dynamics and the control used for quadcopter stabilization. Includes a simulation and movie.
